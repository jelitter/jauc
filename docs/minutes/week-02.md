## Points to Discuss
- [X] SMS provider to pick - Plivo
- [X] Create a new project in GitHub for documentation? -- Docs folder

### Questions for Seamus
* Admin panel > Register/profile/status need to be approved by the administrator. Are we talking about user registration? Car registration? Other admins? It refers to schedule, so we're not sure
* How the Arduino workflow works. Do we need to use SMS send at this point?
* Do we pay in advance or do we pay after the ride? If after, does that means that there may be an unsettled invoice? 

### Ninja Points
Entity ERD diagram. We discussed how these would be implemented and created first mockup.
