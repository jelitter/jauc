# User Stories

## Mobile application
As a user, I want to be able to choose how to create my account, so I can use my favourite social media website instead of typing all the required details for the account.
As a user, I want to store multiple CC and payment methods, so I can control my spending or avoid credit card charges when overspending. 
As a user, I want to be able to change my account and personal details, so I can reflect current data if my personal circumstances change.
As a user, I want to select my pickup location using a map, so I don't have to figure out the street name where I'm currently located or pick a different place to be picked up than the one I'm currently in.
As a user, I want to search manually for the pickup and/or destination, so I don't have to understand the map of my location if I already know the name of the place I want to be collected at.
As a user, I want to change my payment method on each booking, so I can control my expenses better.
As a user, I want to be able to schedule a pick up, so I don't have to wait unnecessarily while the car reaches my location
As a user, I want to track the location of my service, so I can estimate the waiting time until I'm being collected
As a user, I want to receive a notification when my JAUC has arrived to the pick up location, so I can avoid standing outside when weather or street situation does not permit.
As a user, I want to receive any updates regarding my booking, so I can keep myself informed in case there are any changes to the status of my car or booking
As a user, I want to be able to modify or cancel a booking, so I don't accrue any bad rating or additional expenses when emergencies avoid me to get picked up by the service.
As a user, I want to receive an electronic invoice, so I can keep track of my financial records and expenses.
As a user, I want to get an estimated cost of the ride from pick up to destination, so I can choose to cancel the service if I'm not ready to take this expense.
As a user, I want to rate and review my JAUC ride, so the company can make improvements to the service to make it more suitable for me.
