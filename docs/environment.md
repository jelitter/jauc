# Development Environment

## Tooling

- **Communicate**: Slack will be used for communication between team members. A weekly meeting will be scheduled.
- **Document**: We will use Github to document the project. Both from the technical documentation, product backlog, task organization and peer review byt the use of the Github pages, Github projects and Pull Requests Infrastructure.
- **Manage code**: Github will be used for code repository and management.
- **Develop code**: Android Studio will be used to code the android application. Coding the remaining parts of the software has no requirements and anyone can use their preferred IDE of choice.
- **Test**: Unit testing will be done using Karma+Jasmine for the Angular (default preinstalled) and JUnit, Mockito and Espresso for the Android app (also default in Android Studio). The Arduino portion of the development can't be unit tested, so a regular QA lifecycle will be planned for this portion and the remaining of manual testing.
- **Deploy**: Deployment will be done on Heroku
