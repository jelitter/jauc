## Sprint retrospective/review documentation

After stressful semester-end exams, the team was able to come together and re-prioritise the tasks at hand.
What was supposed to be "not that hard", hasn't much increased in difficulty but with the remaining time - especially around the Christmas season - it will be paramount to focus in critical portions of the application stack.
With plenty of distractions around, three major goals are set for the time until new year:
 - Mobile app implementation
 - Middleware
 - Presentation
We are aware that a full implementation over the next 2 weeks to the presentation date is unlikely, however we will push ourselves to deliver a sensible prototype that actually works.
