## Sprint retrospective/review documentation

Given the added work load of other assignments, progress hasn't been as fast as during the initial start-up weeks.
However, based on an continuous effort from all parts of the team, we were able to progress on major interface issues such as admin dashboards and end-user interfaces for the Android app.
